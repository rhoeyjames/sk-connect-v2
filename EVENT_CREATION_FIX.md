# ‚úÖ Event Creation Issue Fixed

Fixed the 500 error when creating events by updating API routes to properly proxy to your Railway backend.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### **Root Cause**
The `/api/events` endpoint was still trying to use local MongoDB connection instead of proxying to your deployed Railway backend.

### **APIs Updated to Proxy to Backend:**
1. **`/api/events`** - Event creation and listing (GET/POST)
2. **`/api/auth/change-password`** - Password changes (PUT)  
3. **`/api/registrations`** - Event registrations (GET/POST)

### **Before (‚ùå)**
- APIs tried to connect to local MongoDB
- Failed with connection errors
- Event creation returned 500 error
- No proper backend integration

### **After (‚úÖ)**
- All APIs proxy to Railway backend: `https://sk-connect-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- Proper authentication headers forwarded
- Error handling for backend responses
- Event creation should work properly

## How Event Creation Works Now

1. **User fills form** with event details (title, description, date, etc.)
2. **Frontend validates** date/time requirements
3. **API call made** to `/api/events` with auth token
4. **Frontend API proxies** request to Railway backend
5. **Backend processes** event creation in MongoDB
6. **Response returned** to frontend with success/error
7. **Events list refreshed** to show new event

## Test Event Creation

1. **Login as admin/SK official** (required for event creation)
2. **Click "Create Event"** button in events page
3. **Fill out the form** with event details:
   - Title: Required
   - Description: Required  
   - Date & Time: Must be in future
   - Location: Required
   - Category: Required
   - Max Participants: Optional (defaults to 50)
   - Registration Deadline: Must be before event date
4. **Submit form** - should show success message
5. **Verify event appears** in events list

Event creation should now work properly! üéâ

**Next Steps:**
- Try creating an event again
- If it still fails, check your Railway backend logs
- Ensure your backend has the event creation endpoints

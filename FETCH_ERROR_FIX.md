# ‚úÖ Failed to Fetch Error Fixed

Fixed the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" errors that were preventing events from loading and updates from working.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### **Root Causes:**
1. **Poor error handling** - API routes weren't handling non-JSON responses properly
2. **Environment variable** - Backend URL wasn't properly set in development
3. **JSON parsing errors** - Backend responses causing parse failures

### **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Updated API routes with better error handling:
- `/api/events` (GET/POST)
- `/api/events/[id]` (PUT/DELETE) 
- Added logging for debugging
- Proper handling of non-JSON responses
- Better error messages

#### 2. **Environment Variable Fix**
- Ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is properly set
- Confirmed backend URL: `https://sk-connect-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- Restarted server to apply changes

#### 3. **Backend Connectivity**
- Verified Railway backend is responding (‚úÖ)
- Events endpoint returning data properly (‚úÖ)
- Added test endpoint for diagnostics

## Error Patterns Fixed

### **Before (‚ùå)**
```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
Proxy error: SyntaxError: No number after minus sign in JSON
PUT /api/events/[id] 500 errors
```

### **After (‚úÖ)**
- Proper error handling with detailed logging
- Graceful handling of malformed responses
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Successful backend communication

## Backend Verification

‚úÖ **Backend Health**: `https://sk-connect-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
‚úÖ **Events Endpoint**: Returns event data properly
‚úÖ **CORS Headers**: Configured correctly
‚úÖ **JSON Responses**: Valid format

## How to Test

1. **Visit Events Page** - Should load events properly
2. **Create Event** - Should work without fetch errors
3. **Update Event** - Should save changes successfully
4. **Check Console** - Should see detailed logs if issues occur

## Debugging Added

- Detailed console logging in API routes
- Request/response logging
- Backend URL verification
- Error response capture

---

The "Failed to fetch" errors should now be resolved! üéâ

**Next Steps:**
- Events should load properly
- Event creation/updates should work
- If issues persist, check browser console for detailed error logs

# SKConnect Login Credentials

## Database Connected âœ…
Your MongoDB database is now connected: `mernapp.zomz5.mongodb.net/sk-connect`

## Demo Accounts (Auto-Created)
These accounts will be automatically created when you first try to log in:

### Admin Account
- **Email**: admin@skconnect.com
- **Password**: password
- **Role**: Administrator

### SK Official Account
- **Email**: sk@skconnect.com
- **Password**: password
- **Role**: SK Official

### Youth Member Account
- **Email**: youth@skconnect.com
- **Password**: password
- **Role**: Youth Member

## How It Works
1. When you try to log in, the app connects to your MongoDB database
2. If no users exist, demo accounts are automatically created
3. You can also register new accounts through the registration form
4. All user data is stored in your MongoDB database

**Note**: Demo accounts are created with password "password" for easy testing. You can register additional accounts or modify existing ones as needed.
